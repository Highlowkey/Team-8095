# Team-8095

### Welcome to the NA repository! 

This is a super cool collaboration tool. For the most part you can't break things, so feel free to look around and fiddle with things. 

There are tons of guides online about this stuff. I am also working on a more personalized tutorial that will be out within the next few days (so look forward to that jazz). If you need any help, feel free to reach out to me. Everything here is yours, so do with it what you please.

If you are interested in helping with the programing you should be added to this repository. That will allow you to not only download the most recent changes by others, but also push your own changes to the shared code.

You can always go back to previous states of the git so don't worry if you push something weird and delete everything. 

### Setting things up

I would highly, highly reccomend downloading the desktop GitHub tool. 

https://desktop.github.com/

It is super useful and allows you to push/pull changes in mere seconds. Once you download the GitHubDesktop you can login and clone an existing repository (our repository is "Team-8095" under the NARobotics organization). Once cloned, you can open your android studio and open the project from inside of your git folder (C:\My Documents\GitHub\Team-8095). Any change you make in android studio can then be saved and commited using the GitHubDesktop app (requires a description to upload).

Aside from sending pushes from you computer, you can manually edit all of your files in the online editor if you need to make quick changes. Or quickly want to edit this README file.

TL;DR - GitHub is good

## Good luck and never forget to parse int :)
