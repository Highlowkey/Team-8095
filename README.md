# Team-8095

## Welcome to the NA repository! 

This is a super cool collaboration tool. For the most part you can't break things, so feel free to look around and fiddle with things. 

There are tons of guides online about this stuff. I am also working on a more personalized tutorial that will be out within the next few days (so look forward to that jazz). If you need any help, feel free to reach out to me. Everything here is yours, so do with it what you please.

If you are interested in helping with the programing you should be added to this repository. That will allow you to not only download the most recent changes by others, but also push your own changes to the shared code.

You can always go back to previous states of the git so don't worry if you push something weird and delete everything. 

## Good luck and never forget to parse int :)
