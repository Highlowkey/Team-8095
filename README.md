# Team-8095

### Welcome to the NA repository! 

This is a super cool collaboration tool. For the most part you can't break things, so feel free to look around and get used to it. 

There are tons of guides online about this stuff. I am also working on a more personalized tutorial that will be out within the next few days (so look forward to that jazz). If you need any help, feel free to reach out to me. Everything here is yours, so do with it what you please.

If you are interested in helping with the programing you should be added to this repository. That will allow you to not only download the most recent changes by others, but also push your own changes to the shared code.

You can always go back to previous states of the git so don't worry if you push something weird and delete everything. 

### Setting things up

I would highly, highly reccomend downloading the desktop GitHub tool. 

You can find out how to get everything setup under the Wiki tab or just click this nifty [link](https://github.com/NARobotics/Team-8095/wiki/Getting-Setup)

### What can you do with GitHub?

In the (very) near future the Wiki tab will be populated will all kinds of goodies. That is where the official coding tutorial and all aditional resources will be stored.

For now while things are still under construction, check out the projects tab and start thinking of things that need to be done/researched. If you have anything you want to put in the Wiki, go right on ahead. And most importantly, help correct my spelling misakes pl0x.


TL;DR - GitHub is super cool and you will learn to love it.

## Good luck and never forget to parse int :)
